                        Hi, I’m Keerthi – 
a student and a beginner in embroidery, stepping into the world of creativity with hope and passion. I recently discovered that creativity is not just a hobby but my true calling. I’m weaving it into my dream of building a unique creative business where imagination meets reality.

Every stitch I make carries a piece of joy, and my wish is simple – to bring a mesmerizing smile to your face through my designs.

This journey is very close to my heart, and I would love your support as I grow, learn, and work towards fulfilling my dream.

<br><br><br>Note: The elegance of this website comes from my supportive dosth, who shaped my ideas into something wonderful. Her story deserves to be celebrated too—so don’t miss the chance to know about her>>
